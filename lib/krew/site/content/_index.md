## What is Krew?

Krew is the plugin manager for `kubectl` command-line tool.

Krew helps you:
- discover [kubectl plugins][kpl],
- install them on your machine,
- and keep the installed plugins up-to-date.

There are [<span class="krew-plugin-count">âŒ›</span> kubectl plugins][list]
currently distributed on Krew.

Krew works across all major platforms, like macOS, Linux and Windows.

Krew also helps kubectl plugin developers: You can package and distribute your
plugins on multiple platforms easily and makes them discoverable through a
centralized plugin repository with Krew.
